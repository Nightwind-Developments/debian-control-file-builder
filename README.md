# Debian Control File Builder
This GitHub Action and its core application can generate a `control` file that can then be used to 
generate Debian Packages.
*Debian Control File Builder* is ideal for applications that require a `control` to be dynamically generated, such as 
generating a Debian Package as part of an automated release with CI/CD.
